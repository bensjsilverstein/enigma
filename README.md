# Enigma_final

This file contains the 'Enigma' final project for Ben Silverstein

### Functionality: 3.0

I gave myself a 3.0 on Functionality because the Enigma class is fully functional with functional encrypt and decrypt methods. Additionally the command line interfaces for encrypt and decrypt are functioning correctly.

### OOP: 4.0

I gave myself a 4.0 on Object Oriented Programming. I successfully broke repetitive or redundant code into 2 separate modules or utilized helper methods. The code is lean, efficient, and dry because of the implementation of the modules. I could easily speak to the single responsibility of each class and the reasoning behind the code inside each class/module.

### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics: 4.0

I gave myself 4.0 for Ruby Conventions and Mechanics. All code is properly indented with spacing that allows it to be easily read. I selected the most affective enumerables, naming conventions are consistent and clear, and I can speak to why each enumerable was chosen. I utilized hashes in multiple instances in ways that were logical. All methods are less than 10 lines.

### TDD: 2.5

I gave myself a 2.5 on Test Driven Development. I have 100% test coverage on SimpleCov. I think the test coverage is robust and demonstrates that methods work as intended. I gave myself a 2.5 because I believe that I could've tested edge cases more affectively.

### Version Control: 3.0

I gave myself a 3.0 on the Version Control. I have more than 40 commits and 4 pull requests. I didn't give myself a 4.0 because I think pull requests could've been more logically spaced. Aside from my early commits, the majority of commits were for small functional changes.

## Total Score: 3.3
